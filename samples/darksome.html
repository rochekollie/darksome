        The Gospel of John is the fourth of the canonical gospels. Like the
        other gospels it is anonymous, although it identifies an unnamed
        "disciple whom Jesus loved" as the source of its traditions. It is
        closely related in style and content to the three Johannine epistles,
        and most scholars treat the four books, along with the Book of
        Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not from
        the same author. The discourses contained in this gospel seem to be
        concerned with issues of the churchâ€“synagogue debate at the time of
        composition. It is notable that in John, the community appears to
        define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism, rather than as part of
        a wider Christian community.

      In the beginning, was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
      was God. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his
      glory, glory as of the only Son from the <b>Father</b>, full of grace and
      truth. For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For
      the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through <span
